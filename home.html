            <h2>WHY IS IT RELEVANT?</h2>
        <p>The "middle-class" is being swiftly demolished...</p>
        <p>It’s now more important than ever you learn a high income skill that will skyrocket your net earnings through the roof…</p>
        <p>
            Something you’d enjoy doing even on a bad day, adding value in as many peoples live as possible and still 'making tens of thousands of dollars monthly like they're going out of fashion'...
        </p>
        <p> Otherwise you’ll be stuck in the mind draining 9 to 5 and continue to struggle, especially as times continue to get tighter and tougher.</p>
        <p>Now, imagine yourself:</p>  
        <li>creating impressive video contents worth while to the last second and you won't ever have to show your face</li> 
        <li>Posting on YouTube</li>
        <li>
        Getting a lot of views and making money off it!
        </li>
        <li>Monetizing your channel and making money off it!!
        </li>
        <li>At the same time, getting non stop Affiliate Marketing commissions of up to $1,000 per sale on high ticket products and services you promote on the same YouTube video and for just little efforts
        </li>
        <p>
            This program teaches how to make these imaginations a reality. As well as provides 24/7 support and guidance while you make everything happen and even afterwards. 
        </p>
        <p><b><i>PS: High ticket Offers are available for every profitable niche you choose. This program will guide you towards finding a profitable niche and relevant HT Offers you can promote and earn with on an autopilot.</i></b></p>
        <p>
        As you may know, inflation is hitting all-time highs throughout the world. And at the rate it’s going, by the time you finish reading this, your gas (petrol) amongst other things could be even more expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, it’s not how hard you work that earns you a good life, it’s how smart you work hard, how much value you give and to how many people... Successful people know that and use it to their advantage. That's the foundation of <b>acheiving</b> financial independence...
        </p>
        <p>
            Having the right resources to pursue your dreams and the life you want also makes every step of your way a lot easier and even fun. Especially education, having the knowledge of what to do and what not to do.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, if that’s not a reason to learn this high income skill, then I don’t know what is. But, let’s get candid for a moment…
        </p>
        <p><b><i>Here’s the cold harsh truth about starting a YouTube channel</i></b>...</p>
        <p>
        Almost everyone hears about how they can make it on YouTube, but then start out to experience the complete opposite of that, including Jordan.
        </p>
        <p>
                They're not getting views and engagements, and they feel like all their time and effort went for nothing…
            </p>
          <p>  
        They feel incapable...
        </p>
        <p>
        They tell themselves disempowering words like <b><i>"I am never going to open YouTube again" </i></b>and that's how they feel, because it's really difficult, and people who've tried before know it.
        <br><br> 

        It's really difficult to find proper and impressive content not to talk of proper editing, and animating, to make high quality videos. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The average person spends anywhere between 3 to 5 hours making voice covers and animating a single video, only to find out they've a ton of mistakes...
        </p>
        <p>
            And the sad part? They don't even get public recognition after all that time and effort spent. Makes them feel all the more "I am never going to open YouTube again"
        </p>
        <p>
            And even when they manage to create impressive videos with proper animating and voice covers, SEO becomes another problem, they can't use it to their advantage and rank high on search engines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thumbnails too - do a lot of good work for your videos, they dont know how to best use them to make clicking on their videos irresistible.
        </p>
        <p>That's why they start having limiting beliefs holding them back from the success and life that they dream of.</p>
        <p><b><i>While the only problem being that they don't have the SKILL</i></b></p>
        <p>
        If they don’t give up, and do finally build and grow their YouTube channel (usually through years and years of trial, error, pain, and frustration)… They begin to see changes and they start generating revenues but even then, it's always not even close to what they had imagined and now they can't let go because they've invested soo much time, effort and resources on the channel (and so the frustration continues).
        </p>
        <p>
            But most people just give up...
        </p>
        <p>
        I know it sounds unimaginable but it’s true, and it’s what happens 9 times out of 10 when you keep pushing without actually getting lessons from "real teachers" who've learnt the secrets and are willing and ready to teach them to you... 
        </p>
        <p>
        So, here’s how this secret impactful collection of strategies and proven methods will help you… <b>start and run a successful YouTube channel with high profit margins while keeping your start up costs at a little to
        zero dollars!</b>

                        <p>All I can say is thank goodness I purchased Jordan’s training course !! Without this training my channel would still be
                        stuck out in the cold getting no traffic at all . After only two weeks of implementing what he teaches I started getting
                        a steady team of views and subs . Before this I only had 127 subs , six weeks later I had meet the requirements to
                        become monetised which just blew me away . A year on I have over 12k subs and making $870 per month , and is steadily
                        climbing . By mid summer this year I plan on quitting my 9-5 job purely because of the growth and revenue my channel
                        will be making . If you are on the fence about diving in , DON’T WAIT ANY LONGER !! Get in right now , now is the best
                        time believe me .</p>
